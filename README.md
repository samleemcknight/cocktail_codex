# Personal Cocktail Codex
The name of this project is "A Personal Cocktail Codex Builder". 

The quintessence of the application is a REST app using Node, Express, and Sequelize with 4 views. The core functionality will allow the user to search pre-populated cocktail recipes in our database. The user can add those to his profile for future easy reference and revisit to update - add more or delete only - the recipes. The site will feature authentication/authorization security protocols.

The relational database will be a Many-to-Many with 3 tables: user account info table, user-selected drinks profile, and a cocktails table (id, drink name, primary alcohol, text block recipe string). The app's UX will be built using BOOTSTRAP. If time permits, the following will be a bonus: a. 1 more table in the database storing user-selected drinks table keyed by main alcohol b. connecting to TheCocktailDB API so users can look up new recipes c. custom CSS will be utilized instead of BOOTSTRAP d. 1 more view displaying the user’s account info (name, e-mail, password).
